# Junk In The Trunk

One day I looked around my home and saw just stuff, organized, some functional, but stuff. The stuff didn't give me fulfillment or any sense of completion. It was just, stuff. In an effort to live free of clutter and find more peace, I decided to get rid of the 'stuff' no longer needed. Worst part is the wasteful footprint. The stuff wasn't needed necessarily. Most of it was collecting dust or 'extra'.

I created a 30-day Junk-In-The-Trunk challenge to get rid of any and all extra items. The only rule was I could only get rid of the item one of five ways.

- Donate
- Recycle
- Gift
- Repurpose
- Sell
